# Linear Equations Solver

Simple tool to solve systems of linear equations using `Gaussian Elimination Method`, `Inverse Matrix Method`, or `Cramer's rules`<br> 
It also can used for adding, subtracting, and substituting variables in linear equations.

There are two classes `linear_equations` & `linear_equs`
ecah one follows different approch in implemtation

The documentation exits in `linear_equations/linear_equations.h` and `linear_equs/linear_equs.h` <br>
you and explore both and use your favourite

A simple main file is provided for `linear_equs` and soon for `linear_equations`
 

# Getting Started
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hassanelshazly/linear_equations_solver

$ cd linear_equations_solver

$ make
```


## Usage

sample files are provided in `tests/` 
```
$ ./main.out < test/test10.txt

$ ./main.out < test/test20.txt
